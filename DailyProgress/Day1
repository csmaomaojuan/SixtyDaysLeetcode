As the running time should be O(log(n)), we should binary search to solve this question.

1. Set two pointer, left pointer point to the first number and right pointer point to the last number of the list.

2. Compare the middle number of the two pointers. If it's equal to target, return the middle.
   If it's smaller than target, move the left pointer point to the middle number.
   Otherwise, move the right pointer point to the middle number.

3. Do step2 unitl we find the result or left and right pointer point to the same number.
